Spotify Data Exploration  
🔍 Overview
This project represents my ongoing journey of exploring and experimenting with existing Spotify data models. I'm using this dataset as a playground to learn new analysis techniques, visualization methods, and data science concepts while uncovering interesting patterns in music trends.

📁 Datasets Used
tracks.csv: Contains comprehensive track information

SpotifyFeatures.csv: Provides genre-specific audio features

🧠 My Learning Objectives
Experimenting with different visualization techniques

Testing correlation hypotheses between audio features

Exploring time-series patterns in music data

Developing my skills in feature engineering

Practicing data cleaning and transformation

🔧 Technical Approach
This project is my sandbox for trying:

Advanced pandas operations beyond basic filtering

Creative visualization with seaborn and matplotlib

Various correlation analysis methods

Time-series manipulation with datetime

Data aggregation techniques

📊 Analysis Highlights
Experimental Visualizations
Correlation heatmaps with custom styling

Regression plots testing different relationships

Temporal analysis with custom time bins

Genre comparisons using various plot types

Interesting Findings
The loudness-energy relationship appears strongly correlated

Acousticness seems inversely related to popularity

Song durations show interesting historical patterns

Some genres maintain consistent popularity

🛠️ Technical Stack
python


Play with the Jupyter notebook

Try modifying parameters or adding new analyses

📝 Notes for Fellow Explorers
This is very much a work in progress

Some analyses are experimental

I welcome suggestions and collaborations

The focus is on learning rather than polished results

🌟 Future Exploration Ideas
Implement audio feature clustering

Build popularity prediction models

Analyze artist networks

Explore natural language processing on track names

Create interactive visualizations

Happy analyzing! 🎧 Let's discover some cool music insights together.
