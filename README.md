Spotify Data Analysis:

Overview:

This project analyzes Spotify music data to uncover insights about song characteristics, popularity trends, and genre differences. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical correlations between various audio features.

Dataset
The project uses two main datasets:

tracks.csv - Contains track information including popularity, duration, audio features (energy, loudness, etc.), and release dates.

SpotifyFeatures.csv - Contains detailed genre information and track features.

Key Analyses Performed
Data Exploration
Basic statistics and information about the tracks dataset

Identification of most and least popular songs

Handling of missing values

Feature Engineering
Conversion of duration from milliseconds to seconds

DateTime conversion of release dates for time-based analysis

Correlation Analysis
Heatmap visualization of correlations between audio features

Specific feature relationships:

Loudness vs Energy

Popularity vs Acousticness

Temporal Analysis
Distribution of songs released per year

Song duration trends over time

Genre Analysis
Duration of songs across different genres

Popularity of top genres

Dependencies
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

How to Run
Ensure all dependencies are installed

Place the dataset files in the correct directory (../input/spotify-datasets/)

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the analysis code

Key Findings
Strong correlation between loudness and energy in songs

Negative correlation between popularity and acousticness

Trends in song duration over the years

Most popular genres on Spotify

Visualizations
The project includes multiple visualizations:

Correlation heatmaps

Scatter plots with regression lines

Histograms of song releases by year

Bar plots of song duration and genre popularity

Future Work
Potential extensions:

Predictive modeling of song popularity

Clustering of songs based on audio features

Analysis of artist-specific trends
